        <h2>Persona: Ethan, a electrical engineer</h2>
        <p>Ethan is a 22-year-old electrical engineer in downtown Denver, CO. Although the company he works for is based in Seattle their only 
            requirement is to live on the West coast and felt Denver would be a great place to explore. Ethan travels to different sites 
            around the world troubleshooting products made by his company. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical from Liberty University. </p>

        <p>Although he spent most of his life moving due to his mothers job, his decision to live away from family was to test his sense 
            of adventure and meet new people. He comes from a large Italian family that believed in sitting down at the table for every meal. 
            As a bachelor living with two roommates and a job that keeps him busy his meals are either frozen or take-out. Ethanâ€™s new goal is 
            to focus on his health but wants to ease into it because of his busy schedule. He wants to learn straightforward but flavorsome 
            recipes to meal prep for a quick grab and go or to make with his roommates. He is interested in using FlavorFind as his one stop shop to cultivate new ideas and dishes that are simple to assist him on his health journey.
