        <h2>Persona: Cassandra, a full time employee and student</h2>
        <p>Cassandra is a 29-year-old who works in Human Resources full time and is going to school full time for a masters degree.
            Cassandra recently relocated to Louisville, KY with her family. In her free time she likes to explore the city and go thrifting with her friends.
        </p>

        <p> Despite her busy schedule, Cassandra is determined to prioritize her well-being and likes to make homecooked meals that remind her of her little Mississippi hometown.
            Through various vacations with her husband, Cassandra has fallen in love with the food and culture of New Orleans. Cassandra has set goals for herself this year 
            by ordering out less and making more nutritious homecooked meals. Due to her busy schedule Cassanda has found that making the more complex meals on the weekends will be 
            a fun activity for her family. During the week Cassandra would like more simple meals that can be made in one pot or even her new obsession the crockpot. Cassandra 
            has even thought about meal prepping on the weekends to help reduce her stress throughtout the week when it comes to cooking meals.
            Cassandra's interest in FlavorFind is driven by her desire to discover quick and easy recipes that align seamlessly with her busy schedule.
