        <h2>Fundamental Questions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1. How should the system be organized as a set of architectural components, where each of these components provides a 
                subset of the overall system functionality?</li>
                <p>
                Our system is organized as a four layered model, this can be referenced in the link below. The first and bottom layer represents the 
                API database, the middle and second layer is the external API, Spoonacular, and the third layer as the backend server that provides 
                the logic and functionality of our system. Our top and final layer is the user interface that communicates with clients and displays the 
                functionality of FlavorFind. 
                </p><br>

            <li>2. How should these architectural components be distributed and communicate with each other?</li>
            <p>
            Each of our components are distributed independently, the bottom layer API database relays requests from the Spoonacular API
            and only communicate with each other. Since we have no communication with the API database, if the API database is not available the 
            software system will no longer be functional. The second layer is Spoonacular API, we created an account to utilize its services and in turn 
            we are provided documentation of API functions made available to us. Based on the type of account varies the types of services provided. 
            This layer communicates with the backend component and with the features we've implemented we're able to relay information between the backend and 
            Spoonacular API. The limitations of this layer are dependent on our account type and the services provided to us. The third component, our backend server 
            has the logic and functionality to pull information from the Spoonacular API that is based on the API database and relays that information to the top layer, the user
            interface and client interaction. The backend communicates with the top layer, the user interface, to package information requested by the client. 
            The top layer is concerned with user interface management, if any lower levels are affected it will lose functionality. 
            Our system distributes as a client-server architecture, utilizing HTTP protocol, we created a complex search URL that communicates with the 
            API and relays information to the client. 
            </p><br>
            <li>3. What technologies should you use in building the system and what components should be reused?</li>
            <p>
                Technologies we've implemented into our system are delivery platform and development tools. Our system utilizes a web-based platform and 
                the development tools applied is a frontend CSS framework, Bootstrap, this component is an open source framework and can be reused. It provided 
                faster resources than starting from sctrach and displayed a cleaner and comprehensive look for our product. Another reusable source is the external API, Spoonacular, 
                it helped provide a streamline of services to create the basis of our recipe generator.
