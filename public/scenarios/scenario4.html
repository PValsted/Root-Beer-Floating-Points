        <h2>Taylor's Scenarios</h2>
        <b>Navigating with simplicity and clarity</b><br>
        <p>
            Taylor wants to stick to the basics of cooking, even if the recipes are time-consuming or are complex. She has little patience for redundancy or content that
            distracts from the necessities of a recipe. She dislikes most existing apps because they include extraneous features such as comment sections and
            personal anecdotes about the dishes. Taylor uses FlavorFind to browse recipes in a fashion that is straightforward and yields easy-to-follow results.
            The existing system lacks effective visuals such as images and videos. FlavorFind could ensure each recipe page only includes the recipes and some
            visuals, as well as the necessary tags and buttons.<br>
        </p> <br>

        <b>Cooking recipes for groups</b><br>
        <p>
           Taylor wants to cook meals for groups and for gatherings. She enjoys cooking, and to her, increasing portion sizes is just another excuse to cook more
           and for longer. She comes home from work often exhausted, and the last thing she wants to do is deal with numbers or do math after a long day.
           Taylor uses FlavorFind to find dishes to cook for her husband's work friends and for family gatherings on holidays. The existing system lacks the ability
           to modify recipe instructions to match portion sizes, increasing Taylor's stress levels when prepping for large groups and increasing the likelihood that
           she makes a mistake with her already strained mind. FlavorFind could implement a way to enter how many people the dish is intended for, which could
           automatically change the amounts of ingredients needed.<br>

        </p><br>
        <b>Finding recipes that use specific ingredients</b><br>
        <p>
            Taylor wants to cook more using the ingredients she knows she loves. Although she enjoys trying new things on occasion, more often than not she prefers
            to stick with what she knows. She has often wished she would cook more cheesy recipes, and she knows she is in the mood for a specific type of dish on
            top of that. Taylor uses FlavorFind to search for recipes that look like they include cheese. The existing system does not include the ability to filter
            a recipe search based on the ingredients it uses, so although cheese is a common ingredient, she has to go in and out of recipes until she finds a dish
            she is in the mood for, hoping it's something with cheese. FlavorFind could add a method to include a filter that only results in recipes that contain
            a specific ingredient, adding another way to narrow search results.<br>
