    <h2>Ethan's Scenarios</h2>

    <b>Mom's pasta recipe:</b><br>
    <p>Ethan spent the day snowboarding with his friends and at the end of the day his friend asked if Ethan could make his mom’s 
        famous pasta dish that he always mentions. Ethan wishes he had a place to save his mom’s recipe without asking her each time 
        he wants to make it. After asking his mom for the recipe, he heads to the grocery store to grab ingredients. As he continues 
        to text his mom, the recipe gets buried in messages and requires more time to scroll through them. Once he finds the text and 
        finishes grocery shopping. He uses FlavorFind to save his mother’s recipe by creating a new recipe and inputs the ingredients, 
        their measurements, and the instructions to follow. </p><br>

    <b>Dinner Time:</b><br>
    <p>
    It is Ethan’s night to cook dinner but one of his roommates is sensitive to dairy. He wants to find lactose intolerant recipes or anything 
    that does not require using dairy. He opens FlavorFind and clicks on the check box ‘lactose intolerant’ before searching for the type of dish 
    he wants to make. After finding one that fits his criteria, Ethan saves it for later in his recipes, hoping it is a hit with his roommates.
    </p><br>

    <b>New health goals:</b><br>
    <p>
        As Ethan navigates through his health journey, he asked his friends and colleagues for recipe ideas or types of food that are easy to make. After 
        collecting ideas, he searches for Mediterranean dishes and chooses an easy level recipe. It populates a list of recipes that fit the criteria and 
        chooses one he likes. A grocery list,  the recipe, and step-by-step instructions are set up ready for Ethan to follow.
