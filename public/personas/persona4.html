        <h2>Persona: Taylor, a vet technician</h2>
        <p>Taylor is a 35-year-old vet tech who works at a spay and neuter volume practice in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
           Along with her husband, she moved in early 2023 from Louisville, KY to her new home, where she quickly adapted to her new life and made plenty of friends.
           Contrasting with the busy landscape of Las Vegas, Taylor enjoys a quiet life with her family of dogs and her husband, who works as a liscensed therapist.
           She enjoys her job as a vet tech, but hopes to go back to school to become liscensed and eventually become a veterinarian. She knows this will not be an
           easy road, but she is more than willing to carve out the time and expenses needed to make her dream come true.</p>

        <p>In addition to taking care of dogs and cats, Taylor has a passion for food. In her free time, whether it be after work or on the weekends, she happily cooks
           meals for herself, her husband, and her friends. She cooks without many specific purposes or restrictions in mind, as she is fortunate enough not to have or
           know anyone who has dietary restrictions holding them back. At this point in her life, she is a competent cook, and the flavor and enjoyment she sees from
           people eating her food gives her the purpose she needs for making meals. Although she likes to keep things simple, she wants to mix things up by trying out new
           recipes. She wants to use FlavorFind as a super straightforward app to discover new dishes and keep the recipes she knows organized.
