    <section>
        <h3 class="interview-questions">What types of cuisines or dishes do you enjoy cooking the most?</h3>
        <p>"I mostly love to cook American or Mexican food the most."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Are there any specific dietary restrictions or preferences you have, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or low-carb?</h3>
        <p>"I nor anyone I know have any dietary restrictions, so I cook with no restrictions."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">How much time do you usually have for meal preparation on a regular basis?</h3>
        <p>"On days I work, I tend to devote 2 hours to meal prep. When it comes to the weekends, I might spend all day on it if it's something I'm passionate about making. My chihuahua Moonpie is my little helper."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Do you prefer quick and easy recipes or are you willing to invest more time for elaborate dishes?</h3>
        <p>"It depends on if I want to make something from scratch. If so, I'm willing to invest more time if it's worth it to do so. Otherwise, it's better to work smarter not harder sometimes."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Are there any ingredients you particularly love or dislike?</h3>
        <p>"I LOVE to use butter and cheese. You can never have too much cheese. I also love to use heavy whipping cream. I'm not picky about food so there are no ingredients I dislike."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">How skilled would you say you are in the kitchen, ranging from beginner to advanced?</h3>
        <p>"I would say I'm intermediate-advanced."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Do you have any kitchen appliances or tools that you frequently use and would like recipes for?</h3>
        <p>"I try to keep things simple and not use any appliances. For example, even though I own a Crock Pot I don't use it often. A wooden spoon and knife is often all I need!"</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Are there specific occasions or events for which you often cook, and what type of recipes are you looking for on those occasions?</h3>
        <p>"I enjoy cooking for any major holiday. I like making Thanksgiving food, and for Christmas I love to bake treats. On Fridays I make meals for my husband's work, so adjusting proportions based on group size is important to me."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">Do you prefer recipes with common and easily accessible ingredients, or are you open to trying unique or exotic ingredients?</h3>
        <p>"Again, I like to keep things simple, so I rarely use ingredients I am unfamiliar with, so I usually just grab things from Walmart. However, on occasion I do shop at a Mexican grocery store."</p>
        <br>

        <h3 class="interview-questions">How often do you like to try new recipes, and what motivates you to explore new dishes?</h3>
        <p>"I do like to try new recipes weekly, so long as they aren't too strange. What motivates me is cooking for others and seeing them enjoy my dish."</p>
